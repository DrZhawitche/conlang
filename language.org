* Introduction
This language is a project I work on in my free time. It is meant to be easy to write and learn, and should thus make for a great way to communicate secretly. I have taken inspiration from languages I have knowledge of (English, French, Arabic, Spanish, Farsi and German) and have incorporated the elements I like from each one, and dropped the ones that displease me.


* Language documentation
** 1. Phonology/Orthography
*** 1.1 Vowels
**** 1.1.1 Short vowels
[name of language] has 4 vowels, which are:
1. a (phonetic: a)
2. u (phonetic: u)
3. i (phonetic: i)
4. o (phonetic: ɵ)
[[images/vowel-chart.png]]

**** 1.1.2 Long vowels
Aswell as their longer counterparts:
1. ā
2. ū
3. ī
4. ō

/I have deicded to make the distinction between the two types of vowels, so there is no ambiguity concerning the pronounciation of a word./

*** 1.2 Consonants
[name of language] has 18 consonants, which are:
1. b [b]
2. d [d]
3. f [f]
4. g [g]
5. h [ɦ]
6. j [ʐ]
7. k [k]
8. l [l]
9. m [m]
10. n [n]
11. p [p]
12. r [ɾ]
13. s [s]
14. t [t]
15. w [W]
16. x [ʃ]
17. y [j] (side note: can *never* be used as a vowel)
18. z [z]
[[images/pulmonic-consonants-chart.png]]
[[images/other-consonants-chart.png]]

*** Individual letter pronounciation
All consonants (when speaking aboout an individual letter) are pronounced by adding an "i" to their end. So, for exampple, b would be "bi", j would be "ʐi", etc... As for vowels, they are pronounced shortly, without adding any consonant to their end (unlike English where "a" is pronounced more like "ay"). I hope this makes sense.

** 2. Grammatical structure

/This section was heavily inspired by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto][Esperanto]]./

*** 2.1 Nouns and adjectives

| *Noun*     | *Subject* | *Object* |   | *Adjective* | *Subject* | *Object* |
|------------+-----------+----------+---+-------------+-----------+----------|
| *Singular* | -a        | -aj      |   | *Singular*  | -o        | -oj      |
| *Plural*   | -an       | -ajn     |   | *Plural*    | -on       | -ojn     |

/This means that all nouns will end with -a and all adjecctives with -o./

/All derived verbs (from the nouns) end in -u./

/Adjectives always foll​ow the noun./

*** 2.2 Verbal tenses and moods

| *Verbal tense* | *Suffix* |   | *Verbal mood* | *Suffix* |
|----------------+----------+---+---------------+----------|
| *Future*       | -oz      |   | *Infinitive*  | -is      |
| *Present*      | -az      |   | *Jussive*     | -as      |
| *Past*         | -iz      |   | *Conditional* | -os      |

*** 2.3 Defineteness
In [language name], nouns are by default indefinite. To make them definite, an article such as [insert article name] is required.

*** 2.4 Word order
In order to keep this language relatively easy to learn and grasp, I choose the word order to be S-V-O (subject-verb-object).
For example:

** 3. Syllable strucutre
[Name of language] will follow a (C)(C)V(C)(C) structure.

*** 4.3 Verbs
Note: Because verb conjugation is very simple and only depends on the time/mood, there isn't much of a point in conjugating every single verb that will be listed here. For more information check [[#22-verbal-tenses-and-moods][2.2 Verbal tenses and moods]].
