* Introduction
This language is a project I work on in my free time. It is meant to be easy to write and learn, and should thus make for a great way to communicate secretly. I have taken inspiration from languages I have knowledge of (English, French, Arabic, Spanish, Farsi and German) and have incorporated the elements I like from each one, and dropped the ones that displease me.

** 1. Phonology/Orthography
*** 1.1 Vowels
**** 1.1.1 Short vowels
[name of language] has 4 vowels, which are:
1. a (phonetic: a)
2. u (phonetic: u)
3. i (phonetic: i)
4. o (phonetic: ɵ)
[[images/vowel-chart.png]]

**** 1.1.2 Long vowels
Aswell as their longer counterparts:
1. ā
2. ū
3. ī
4. ō

I have deicded to make the distinction between the two types of vowels, so there is no ambiguity concerning the pronounciation of a word.

*** 1.2 Consonants
[name of language] has 18 consonants, which are:
1. b (phonetic: b)
2. d (phonetic: d)
3. f (phonetic: f)
4. g (phonetic: g)
5. h (phonetic: ɦ)
6. j (phonetic: ʐ)
7. k (phonetic: k)
8. l (phonetic: l)
9. m (phonetic: m)
10. n (phonetic: n)
11. p (phonetic: p)
12. r (phonetic: ɾ) (a shortly rolled r)
13. s (phonetic: s)
14. t (phonetic: t)
15. w (phonetic: W)
16. x (phonetic: ʃ)
17. y (phonetic: j) (side note: can *never* be used as a vowel)
18. z (phonetic: z)

*** Individual letter pronounciation
All consonants (when speaking aboout an individual letter) are pronounced by adding an "i" to their end. So, for exampple, b would be "bi", j would be "ʐi", etc... As for vowels, they are pronounced shortly, without adding any consonant to their end (unlike English where "a" is pronounced more like "ay"). I hope this makes sense.

** 2. Grammatical structure
*** 2.1 Word order
In order to keep this language relatively easy to learn and grasp, I choose the word order to be S-V-O (subject-verb-object).
For example:

*** 2.2 Grammar
/This section was heavily inspired by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto][Esperanto]]/
