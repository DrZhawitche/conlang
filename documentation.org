* Introduction
This language is a project I work on in my free time. It is meant to be easy to write and learn, and should thus make for a great way to communicate secretly. I have taken inspiration from languages I have knowledge of (English, French, Arabic, Spanish, Farsi and German) and have incorporated the elements I like from each one, and dropped the ones that displease me.

*** Individual letter pronounciation
All consonants (when speaking aboout an individual letter) are pronounced by adding an "i" to their end. So, for exampple, b would be "bi", j would be "ʐi", etc... As for vowels, they are pronounced shortly, without adding any consonant to their end (unlike English where "a" is pronounced more like "ay"). I hope this makes sense.
